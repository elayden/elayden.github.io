[MRIqual](https://elliotlayden.com/MRIqual) is an open-source Matlab toolbox for examining the quality of structural (SNR) and functional (tSNR, SFNR) MRI brain images. This toolbox was used for examining the temporal signal-to-noise-ratio (tSNR) of resting-state function MRI (rs-fMRI) brain images collected from a sample of zebra finches in Layden et al. (2019). The toolbox box is also compatible with human brain images and could be used to examine the quality (e.g., signal-to-noise-ratio, SNR) of non-brain MRI scans as well. Below are some screenshots of the toolbox and example use cases:
