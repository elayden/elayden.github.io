I am a data scientist based in the Seattle area with 6+ years of experience in research, analytics, and predictive modeling. 

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>I obtained my Ph.D. in integrative neuroscience and psychology from The University of Chicago, where I specialized in human and zebra finch neuroimaging. Specifically, I studied functional connectivity (i.e., correlations between different brain regions' blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals) using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), among other tools. I used this brain data to create predictive models for behavioral outcomes and learning ability (e.g., zebra finch song learning and human perceived social isolation).</p>

<p>In addition to modeling, one of my favorite aspects of research, as well as my current work as a data scientist, is having the opportunity to engineer custom software solutions for the problems I face during the research or modeling process. For instance, I developed a Matlab toolbox for visualizing 3D brain imaging data (NIfTI Studio), which includes the ability to convert and export rendered images for 3D printing. This tool allowed me to perform a number of essential tasks for multiple published papers, including tracing brain regions of interest (ROIs), creating custom 3D rendered figures to represent the data, and even 3D printing a zebra finch brain to use as an educational tool for students.</p> 

<h2>Interests</h2>
<p>One of my favorite hobbies outside of work is developing mobile apps. My major project in this area so far is N-Back Memory Training, a Java-based Android app. The app implements the dual n-back task, which is commonly used is cognitive psychology and neuroscience research. In the Environmental Neuroscience Lab, I adapted a version of this app to allow us to collect experimental data outside of the laboratory for an experience sampling study, as well as a Matlab-based version that allowed us to collect data from research participants concurrently with fMRI scanning. Currently, I am working with a collaborator to develop an app in the personal finance area (more to come on this).</p> 

<p>When I'm not working or building apps, I enjoy exploring the many great natural areas near Seattle, either hiking or cycling.</p>
